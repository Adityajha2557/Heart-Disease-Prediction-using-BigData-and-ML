# Heart Disease Prediction using Big Data and Machine Learning

## Overview
This project presents a scalable predictive analytics framework for heart disease risk assessment using Big Data and Machine Learning techniques. It is designed to handle large and complex healthcare datasets while delivering accurate, reliable, and interpretable predictions.

The system integrates distributed data processing with multiple Machine Learning and Deep Learning models, supported by interactive visual analytics for enhanced interpretability and decision support.

## Key Objectives
- Analyze large-scale healthcare datasets efficiently  
- Predict heart disease risk using ML and DL models  
- Ensure scalability, robustness, and interpretability  
- Support data-driven clinical decision-making  

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing and feature analysis on large datasets  
- Model development using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques  
- Performance evaluation using standard classification metrics  
- Interactive visualization and comparative analysis using Power BI  

## Technologies Used
- **Big Data:** Hadoop, Apache Spark  
- **Machine Learning:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees
